ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @roquecrouch
I am a student, not currently studying towards a degree, but spending a lot of time dabbling in the world of programming. 
I'm a musician, an athelete, and I thouroughly enjoy the mathematical side of scripting. Some of the topics that really interest me are:

-Artifical intelligence 
-Automation
-cyber security

I juggle school, work, and my various hobbies, so my presence is not always consistent. However the world of IT is not something I will 
ever leave behind.
